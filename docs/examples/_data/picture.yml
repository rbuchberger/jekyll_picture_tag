# Example picture presets:
# TODO: change to EMs, because safari sucks.

# Media presets are used in several places:
# - To specify alternate source images (for art direction)
# - To build the 'sizes' attribute
# - When given alternate source images, specify which sizes to generate.
media_presets:
  wide_desktop: 'min-width: 1801px'
  desktop: 'max-width: 1800px'
  wide_tablet: 'max-width: 1200px'
  tablet: 'max-width: 900px'
  mobile: 'max-width: 600px'

# Markup presets allow you to group settings together, and select one of them by name in your jekyll
# tag. All settings are optional.
markup_presets:
  default:

    # Optionally specify a markup type. Your current options are 'picture', 'img', or 'auto'
    # (default).
    markup: auto

    # Must be an array, in order of decreasing preference. Defaults to just 'original'.
    formats: [webp, original]

    # Must be an array: which image sizes (width in pixels) to generate (unless directed otherwise
    # below). If not specified, will use sensible default values.
    widths: [200, 400, 800, 1600]

    # Alternate source images (for art direction) are associated with media query presets. Here, you
    # can optionally specify a different set of sizes to generate for those alternate source images.
    # This is how you avoid generating a 1800 pixel wide image that's only shown on narrow screens.
    # Must be arrays.
    media_widths: 
      mobile: [200, 400, 600] 
      tablet: [400, 600, 800]

    # Specifies an optional, unconditional size attribute. Can be given alone, or if specified in
    # combination with 'sizes' below, will be given last (when no media queries apply).
    size: 800px

    # For building the 'sizes' attribute on img and source tags. specifies how wide the image will
    # be when a given media query is true. Note that every source in a given <picture> tag will have
    # the same associated sizes attribute.
    sizes: 
      mobile: 100vw
      desktop: 60vw

    # Specify the properties of the fallback image. If not specified, will return a 900 pixel
    # wide image in the original format.
    fallback_width: 800
    fallback_format: original

    # Attributes can be added to each HTML element, by type:
    attributes:
      picture: 'class="awesome" data-volume="11"'
      img: 'class="some-other-class"'

  # This is an example of how you would create a 'multiplier' based srcset; useful when an image
  # will always be the same size on all screens, but you'd like to supply higher resolution images
  # to devices with higher pixel ratios.
  icon:
    base_width: 20
    pixel_ratios: [1, 1.5, 2]
    fallback_width: 20
    attributes:
      img: 'class="icon"'

  # Here's an example of how you'd configure jekyll-picture-tag to work with something like
  # lazyload:
  # https://github.com/verlok/lazyload
  lazy:
    markup: data_auto
    formats: [webp, original]
    widths: [200, 400, 600, 800]
    noscript: true # Default: false
    attributes: 
      img: class="lazy"

  # This is an example of how you'd get generated image and a URL, and nothing else.
  direct:
    markup: direct_url
    fallback_format: webp # Default original
    fallback_width: 600 # Default 800
