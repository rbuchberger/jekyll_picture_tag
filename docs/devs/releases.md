# Release History

* 2.1.3 10 June, 2025
  * Decide whether to call `magick` or `convert` more intelligently. This adds Windows support, without breaking JPT on Ubuntu or other distros that only ship an ancient version of ImageMagick. Thanks to [@MUmarShahbaz](https://github.com/MUmarShahbaz) for [#324](https://github.com/rbuchberger/jekyll_picture_tag/pull/324)
* 2.1.2 13 September, 2024
  * Remove overly specific version spec for ruby-vips - thanks to [@hschne](https://github.com/hschne) for [#313](https://github.com/rbuchberger/jekyll_picture_tag/pull/313)
* 2.1.1 20 July, 2024
  * Don't provide Q setting for PPM images - thanks to @dichiban for [#309](https://github.com/rbuchberger/jekyll_picture_tag/pull/309)
  * Fix alpha premultiplication - thanks to @KaarlisCaune for [#302](https://github.com/rbuchberger/jekyll_picture_tag/pull/302)
* 2.1.0 29 January, 2024
  * Check whether the vips CLI is installed before trying to use it. Thanks to @philrb for
    [#299](https://github.com/rbuchberger/jekyll_picture_tag/pull/299)
  * Update minimum required mocha version to maintain compatibility with minitest
* 2.0.4 August 16, 2022
  * Fix backend format support detection for new versions of libvips & imagemagick
* 2.0.3 April 1, 2021
  * Improve backend format support detection
* 2.0.2 March 31, 2021
  * Do not pass a quality argument when generating PNG files.
    * It only works on newer versions of vips, breaking builds when using older
      versions (such as when deploying to netlify.)
    * It's not remarkably useful in the first place.
* 2.0.1 March 31, 2021
  * Select imagemagick deliberately when appropriate, rather than simply rescuing all vips errors
    and trying again. This will stop JPT from suppressing useful vips errors.
* **2.0** March 25, 2021 - [Migration guide](/jekyll_picture_tag/users/notes/migration_2)
  * Switch from ImageMagick to libvips.
    * ðŸš€ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥**MUCH MORE FASTER**ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸš€
    * Will still attempt to use imagemagick if libvips cannot handle a
      particular image format.
    * Eliminate the ImageMagick v7 on Ubuntu pain we've been dealing with for so
      long.
  * Require Ruby >= 2.6, support Ruby 3.0
  * Require Jekyll >= 4.0
  * Cropping is changing.
    * We now use the libvips
        [smartcrop function](https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/ruby-vips/Vips/Image#smartcrop-instance_method),
        which does some magic to keep the most useful part of the image.
    * Geometry is renamed to 'crop', and reduced to simple aspect ratios only. (`width:height`)
    * Gravity is gone, replaced by 'keep' which is translated to a libvips
        [interestingness](https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/ruby-vips/Vips/Interesting) setting.
  * Add stock presets and media queries, under the `jpt-` prefix.
  * Add `format_quality` default settings for webp, avif, and jp2.
  * Add image-format-specific write options.
  * Overhaul user input handling; we can now validate inputs and give error
    messages which are less useless. Stronger validation and nicer errors will be added in future
    releases.
  * Drop support for `markup_presets` and `media_presets`. They are now
    officially and only `presets` and `media_queries`.
  * Improve docs with an introductory tutorial and 'how-to' flow.
* 1.14.0 January 10, 2021
  * Gracefully handle empty tag arguments.
  * Re-add metadata stripping. I removed it inadvertently when refactoring; now
    there's a test and a setting to turn it off.
  * Respect Jekyll's `--disable-disk-cache` argument.
  * Add baseurl configuration, allowing increased plugin support (such as I18n via `jekyll-multiple-languages-plugin`)
  * Tooling & test suite maintenance and improvements.
* 1.13.0 November 23, 2020
  * Add image quality interpolation; allows for variable image quality based on image size.
  * Bugfix: Perform format, resize, and quality changes simultaneously rather than individually.
    * Allows for actual lossless webp: simply set quality to 100.
    * Improves fresh (no cached images) build times by ~15%
    * Fix problems with poor image quality.
* 1.12.0 July 30, 2020
  * Documentation overhaul. Now with 87% less scrolling!
  * Rename `markup_presets` and `media_presets` to `presets` and
    `media_queries`. The old names were bad and caused confusion. The old names
    will continue to work until the next major version is released.
* 1.11.0 July 27, 2020
  * **Width and height attribute support!** Begone, page reflow.
  * Cache image information between builds
  * Change image naming format. This update will trigger all images to be
    regenerated, so you may want to delete your generated images folder
    beforehand.
* 1.10.2 July 6, 2020
  * Bugfix for fallback image files not actually getting generated
* 1.10.1 July 2, 2020
  * Bugfix for erroneously regenerated images
* 1.10.0 May 11, 2020

  * Documentation improvements
* 1.9.0 Feb 2, 2020
  * Add `fast_build` global setting
  * Add `disabled` global setting
  * Reduce unnecessary disk IO; sites with many source images should see build
  times improve when no new images need to be generated.
  * Add support for empty attributes; specifically so best-practice for
    decorative images (`alt=""`) is possible.
* 1.8.0 Nov 25, 2019
  * Add `data_sizes` setting for the `data_` family of output formats.
* 1.7.1 Nov 14, 2019
  * Fix some HTML attribute related bugs
  * Add a few items to the FAQ
* 1.7.0 Aug 12, 2019
  * Add support for setting generated image quality, either generally or
    specific to given formats.
  * Add support for spaces and other url-encoded characters in filenames
  * Documentation restructure - Moved it out of the wiki, into the `docs`
    folder.
  * Bugfix: Fallback image width will now be checked against source image width.
  * Bugfix: Minor fix to nomarkdown wrapper output
  * link_source will now target the base source image, rather than finding the
    biggest one.
  * Remove fastimage dependency, add addressable dependency.
  * Moderately significant refactoring and code cleanup
  * Decent set of tests added
* 1.6.0 Jul  2, 2019:
  * Missing Preset warning respects `data_dir` setting
  * Add `continue_on_missing` option
* 1.5.0 Jun 26, 2019:

  * Rename gem from `jekyll-picture-tag` to `jekyll_picture_tag`, allowing us to
    use rubygems again.

* 1.3.0 Jun  7, 2019:
  * Initial compatibility with Jekyll 4.0

  * Add nomarkdown fix
  * noscript option
  * relative url option
  * anchor tag wrappers
* 1.1.0 Jan 22, 2019:
